# `giabaio.r-universe.dev`

This is the `r.universe.dev` repository. It can be used to manage packages in [`R universe`](https://giabaio.r-universe.dev/).

Full instructions on how to set up the whole universe are available [here](https://docs.r-universe.dev/publish/set-up.html). Basically, the one file in this repo is what is used to populate the `universe` with packages.
